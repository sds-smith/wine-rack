# Wine Rack

A wine inventory management tool built with NextJS-15 and MongoDB

I built this application for someone close to me, to replace his dated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and provide a more robust solution for tracking and managing the wines in his cellar.

It seemed like a good opportunity to get hands-on with the latest versions of NextJS (15) and React (19), including some of the newest features of each. This project leverages NextJS App Router, as well as React Server Components, Server Actions, and the new useActionState hook.

The tech stack also includes:
  * Next-auth (Auth.js)
  * MongoDB
  * MaterialUI and MUI/X-Charts
  * Zod
